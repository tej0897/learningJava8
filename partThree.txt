Method References:

    1. Purpose is to simplify the implementation of Functional Interfaces.
    2. Shortcut for Lambda expressions.
    3. Used to refer a method in a class.

    Syntax:
            className :: instance-methodName
            className :: static-methodName
            Instance :: methodName

using lambda:

Function<String,String> example = s -> s.toUpperCase();

                        ******

using method reference:

Function<String, String> example = String::toUpperCase;


Where Method Reference is not applicable?
When we write our own logic, it becomes tricky to apply method reference.

Example:
    Predicate<Student> example = s -> s.getGrade()>=3;

Method Reference: Function Interface

Function<String, String> example = String::toUpperCase;

Use IntelliJ to convert lambdas into Method References.
